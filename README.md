### Agile Methodology

The agile planning approach was employed in the development of this site, wherein each user feature was broken down into individual user stories, each accompanied by specific acceptance criteria. These criteria were then translated into tasks, serving as markers of completion for the respective user stories.

To enhance functionality, interconnected user stories that contributed to specific site features were grouped into broader Epics. User stories were categorized as Must Have, Should Have, or Could Have, aiding in prioritization during the implementation process.

As the site evolved, tasks were refined or adapted based on changing user needs and a more mature understanding of project requirements. GitHub Issues and the Kanban board within the GitHub Projects view served as the structural framework. The project was organized into several sections:

* To Do - Serving as the initial repository for all user stories.
* In Progress - Active development stories were tracked in this phase.
* Done - Successfully developed stories found their place here.
* Future - This section was reserved for 'could have' stories containing features earmarked for potential implementation at a later stage due to time limitations.

Feel free to explore the Kanban Board for a visual representation of the user stories [here](https://github.com/users/Freedy-FR/projects/6).

### The Scope

#### Main Site Goals

- To provide users with comprehensive information about the products, including detailed product information, images, and options to buy or add to favorites.
- To provide users with a visually pleasing website that is intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear and consistent navigation options.
- To provide a website with a clear purpose, ensuring that users can easily access key functionalities such as account management, order management, and product browsing.
- To provide tools that allow users to search for products, including a search system and sorting options for easy access to specific products and deals.
- To provide users with an easy and safe way to buy their products, ensuring secure payment processing through Stripe, a well-organized shopping cart system, and clear checkout procedures.


## Design

### Colour Scheme for MagnaPlate Website

The Colour scheme for the MagnaPlate website was meticulously selected to enrich the visual appeal of the plates (posters) and provide an engaging user experience. The Colours were chosen from [Coolors](https://coolors.co/), ensuring a harmonious blend that enhances the aesthetic quality of the site.

#### Colour Palette:

- **FBFBFB (White)**: This bright, clean shade is used for the background, offering a crisp and neutral canvas that makes other Colours and content stand out.

- **EEEEEE (Light Gray)**: A soft, light gray tone that adds subtle depth and contrast to the design elements without overpowering them.

- **4F4F4F (Medium Gray)**: Used for text and secondary elements, this medium gray ensures readability and complements the overall Colour scheme.

- **000000 (Black)**: The primary Colour for text, providing strong contrast and excellent legibility against the white and light gray backgrounds.

- **2846A1 (Dark Blue)**: This deep blue shade is employed in headers and key navigation elements, evoking a sense of trust and stability.

- **1C4AB2 (Blue)**: A vibrant blue used for links and call-to-action buttons, drawing attention without being too aggressive.

- **133398 (Navy Blue)**: Incorporated in the logo and other prominent elements, this navy blue adds a touch of professionalism and sophistication.

- **B81916 (Red)**: This bold red is used sparingly to highlight important information and create a sense of urgency or importance.

- **A10F0D (Dark Red)**: A darker red shade that complements the bold red, adding depth and visual interest to the design.

The use of these Colours has been consistently maintained throughout the website and checked for contrast to allow easy accessibility. The combination of these carefully selected Colours ensures that the MagnaPlate website is not only visually appealing but also user-friendly and accessible to all visitors.

### Typography

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) were used as below:

* Galada is used for the Logo.
* Signika Negative is used for the Headings.
* Roboto is used for the body of the text.

### Imagery

The MagnaPlate website relies on thumbnails to render nice images, enhancing both efficiency and aesthetics. Thumbnails are rendered on the products page to help with quick loading times, while the product detail pages display the full image. Users also have the option to view images in full screen using [fslightbox](https://fslightbox.com), allowing them to see every detail clearly.

The images and placeholders were sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and some images were generated using AI with ChatGPT, while the Favicon icon was obtained from [Favicon](https://favicon.io/). Some of the images have also been sourced from a Discord group, noted in the credits.

### Carousel

The carousel on the MagnaPlate website serves as a dynamic and engaging feature to showcase key highlights and promotions. The design of the carousel includes the following elements:

- **Responsive Design**: The carousel is fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

- **High-Quality Thumbnails**: Each slide in the carousel displays a high-quality thumbnail image, providing a preview of the featured content.

- **Gradient Background**: The gradient background transitions smoothly between shades of blue and red, creating a visually appealing backdrop that enhances the displayed images.

- **Navigation Arrows**: Discreet navigation arrows are placed on either side of the carousel, allowing users to easily browse through the slides.

- **Featured Content**: The carousel prominently features key promotional images, such as new arrivals, special offers, and featured collections, to draw attention and engage users.

- **Efficiency and Aesthetics**: Thumbnails are used in the carousel to maintain quick loading times and enhance the aesthetic appeal of the website.

The use of the carousel helps to keep the website dynamic and interactive, providing users with a visually rich experience that highlights important content and promotions effectively.

11. Click "Add statement > Generate Policy" and copy the policy that's been generated and paste this into the "Bucket Policy Editor".
12. Before saving, add /\* at the end of your "Resource Key", this will allow access to all resources within the bucket.

### Webhooks

1. To set up a webhook, sign into your stripe account and click 'Developers' located in the top right of the navbar.
2. Then in the side-nav under the Developers title, click on "Webhooks", then "Add endpoint".
3. On the next page you will need to input the link to your heroku app followed by /checkout/wh/. It should look something like this:

   ```
   https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/
   ```

4. Then click "+ Select events" and check the "Select all events" checkbox at the top before clicking "Add events" at the bottom. Once this is done finish the form by clicking "Add endpoint".
5. Your webhook is now created and you should see that it has generated a secret key. You will need this to add to your heroku config vars.
6. Head over to your app in heroku and navigate to the config vars section under settings. You will need the secret key you just generated for your webhook, in addition to your Publishable key and secret key that you can find in the API keys section back in stripe.
7. Add these values under these keys:

   ```
   STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'insert your stripe publishable key'
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = 'insert your secret key'
   STRIPE_WH_SECRET = 'insert your webhooks secret key'

   ```

8. Finally, back in your settings.py file in django, insert the following near the bottom of the file:
   ```
   STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY', '')
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', '')
   STRIPE_WH_SECRET = os.getenv('STRIPE_WH_SECRET', '')
   ```

1. Go to the Code Institute Gitpod Full Template [Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)
2. Click on Use This Template
3. Once the template is available in your repository click on Gitpod
4. When the image for the template and the Gitpod are ready open a new terminal to start a new Django App
5. Install Django and gunicorn: pip3 install django gunicorn
6. Install supporting database libraries dj_database_url and psycopg2 library: pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2
7. Create file for requirements: in the terminal window type pip freeze --local > requirements.txt
8. Create project: in the terminal window type django-admin startproject your_project_name
9. Create app: in the terminal window type python3 manage.py startapp your_app_name
